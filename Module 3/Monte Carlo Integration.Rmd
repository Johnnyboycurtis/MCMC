## Introduction

Beyond being able to generate random variables, we should also be able to apply these simulation methods to solve more complex problems. We'll begin with Monte Carlo Integration methods.

Topics to be covered:

1. Classic Monte Carlo Integration

2. Importance Sampling

3. Importance Sampling Resampling




## Monte Carlo Integration

Given a function $g(x)$ for which we wish to integrate over [a,b], $\int_a^b g(x) dx$, we can treat this deterministic problem as a stochastic one to find the solution. Treat X as if a random variable with density $f(x)$, then the mathimatical expecation of the random variable $Y = g(X)$ is 
$$
E[g(X)] = \int_{- \infty}^{\infty} g(x) f(x) dx
$$

If a random sample $X_1, ..., X_n$ is generated from $f(x)$, an unbiased estimator of $E[g(X)]$ is the sample mean.
